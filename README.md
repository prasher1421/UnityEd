"Unifying Education and Empowering Minds"

Despite having one of the largest education systems in the world, India still faces challenges in providing quality education to all its citizens. Access to education is often hindered by factors such as socio-economic inequality, cultural and linguistic diversity, and the urban-rural divide. This not only deprives students of their basic right to education but also perpetuates the cycle of poverty and social inequality.

To address these challenges and promote quality education for all, we have developed UnityEd - an app that aims to unify education and empower minds. Our app provides affordable and accessible education to students across India and keeps them updated with the latest advancements in their fields of interest.

## Features

## Goals

At UnityEd, we are committed to the United Nations' goal for "Quality Education" and aim to eliminate discrimination in education by providing equal access to affordable technical, vocational, and higher education. By addressing systemic issues in the Indian education system, we strive to promote a future where all citizens have access to quality education that equips them with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in a rapidly changing world.
